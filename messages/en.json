It's a full-stack mobile and web app - a SAAS - that allows users to create an account and register games from the largest API database. Games can be put in different lists : games you've played, games you're currently playing, and most importantly, the games that you want to play - your 'backlog'. This is still in progress and other functions are coming, like the game rating. The app is primarily usable on Android as a Native app, made with React Native, and will be available on the Play Store.",

Here you can see elements like the programming interfaces provided by the website - Python here - or the 'print mode' for the ressources, to make them more accessible for the schools. I had to adapt the high-contrast mode for the interfaces, because it wasn't available at first. I also added aria-labels to the elements, and made them usable with the keyboard of the user. I also created new pages from scratch, like the glossary. Vittascience gave me lots of experience about the accessibility of the web.",

Adding or editing links and pictures changes the website without having to redeploy it. It's a fun project and I plan on updating it. This project leads to personnal links and socials, so it won't be shared on this portfolio aside from the repository.",
